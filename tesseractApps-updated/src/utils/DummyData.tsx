      "Every day, disability support and aged care providers collect sensitive information — including health records, personal details, and care plans — that participants trust us to protect. Strong data security isn’t a luxury, it’s essential for compliance, service continuity, and, most importantly, client trust.",

      "Cyberattacks targeting the healthcare and disability sectors are rising. In July 2024, for example, a ransomware attack on prescription service MediSecure exposed the health and personal data of approximately 12.9 million Australians. Alarming figures show that 41% of Australian healthcare organisations experienced a cyberattack in 2023. These breaches can compromise privacy, disrupt care delivery, and result in serious regulatory and reputational consequences.",
